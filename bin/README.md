Record transaction details (type, amount, description) for each transaction.

**Transaction Filtering:**
Filter transactions by customer ID, type ("debit" or "credit"), and amount range.

**Data Persistence:**
Utilizes PostgreSQL as the underlying database.
Uses JPA and Hibernate for object-relational mapping.

**RESTful API:**
Exposes endpoints for customer registration, retrieval, and transaction operations.
Uses HTTP methods (POST, GET) for CRUD operations.
Returns JSON responses for API requests.
